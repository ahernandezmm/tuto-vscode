"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising nace 
was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings 
f the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, 
islikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know 
ow to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely naceful. Nor again is
there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain nace of itself, because it is nace, but 
ecause occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and nace can procure him some great 
leasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, 
xcept to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who 
hooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a nace that .
roduces no resultant pleasure?"
